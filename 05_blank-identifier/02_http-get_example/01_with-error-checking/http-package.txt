The net/http package in Go provides a set of functions and types for implementing HTTP clients and servers.

Here are some of the important types and methods provided by this package:

    http.Client: This is the primary type for making HTTP requests. It provides methods such as Get(), Post(),
    and Do() for making GET, POST, and other types of requests, respectively.

    http.NewRequest(): This function creates a new HTTP request. You can specify the HTTP method, URL, headers,
    and body using this function.

    http.ResponseWriter: This is an interface that represents the response writer for an HTTP server. It provides
    methods for writing response headers and response body.

    http.Request: This is a struct that represents an HTTP request. It provides fields for the HTTP method, URL,
     headers, and body.

    http.ServeMux: This is a multiplexer for HTTP requests. It maps incoming requests to their corresponding
    handlers based on the request path.

    http.HandleFunc(): This function registers a handler function for a specific path pattern on a ServeMux.

    http.FileServer(): This function creates an http.Handler that serves static files from a specific directory.

    http.Redirect(): This function sends an HTTP redirect to the client.

    http.Error(): This function sends an HTTP error response to the client.

These are just some of the types and methods provided by the net/http package in Go. The package provides many more
functions and types for implementing HTTP clients and servers, and it is a powerful tool for building web applications
in Go.
